Sexual Education is a Lifelong  Experience

We are all sexual beings, and sexuality is a basic and vital function of our lives: the pleasure it gives us is one of the great joys of existence and sexuality is an important aspect of human nature.

But sexuality, just like adult entertainment, is intended to be enjoyed by adults. Adulthood comes with the information and experience to make responsible decisions to keep ourselves and our partners healthy and content in our relationships.

Social media can create pressure and affect the way we perceive ourselves and the activities that we should be engaged in. The internet is full of mixed messages and may not have your best interest at heart. Any questions related to sex should be asked to people who know us, who we trust, and who can give valuable, tailored advice.

Porn is Porn. Sex is Sex.

It’s called adult entertainment because it’s precisely that; entertainment adults watch for our viewing pleasure.

Porn is meant to entertain, amuse, and arouse us. It’s neither a sex handbook nor educational material.

The massive amount of porn available online can be misleading and create unrealistic expectations of what sex should be like. Although it looks realistic and fun, your sexual life does not have to be dictated by the videos you watch online. Porn is work, and the people on screen are performers. Their job is to make the viewer feel good and not try and represent sex accurately. The actions you see are often choreographed, rehearsed, and it’s actually much harder than it looks to stage those positions. There is planning, wardrobe, scripts, lighting, editing, and so much more that goes into creating a fantasy for every appetite.

Healthy Relationship

From friends to schoolmates, to neighbors, colleagues, and sexual partners, having strong social connections help us lead a longer, happier life. The people in our lives help us manage stress, face challenges, provide companionship, and give us a sense of belonging.

But first and foremost, the most important relationship you’ll ever have is the one you have with yourself. Respect and value for ourselves is of high priority. A healthy relationship starts with each partner having a strong and balanced idea of who they are, enabling them to contribute to the relationship equally and constructively.

Healthy relationships are built on being aware of your feelings and your values AND being aware of and respecting your partner’s feelings, rights, and dignity. Don’t assume that you should think or feel the way they do; you are entitled to have a different opinion or have different feelings.

Compatibility

Relationships thrive when people share companionship and activities, they relate to each other with equality and respect, you share the same values and sexual preferences. They say opposites attract, but when it comes to sex, the greater the compatibility, the greater the sexual satisfaction.

Be aware of your sexual needs, your turn-ons, and turn-offs and communicate this to your partner. Don’t hide how you feel, communication is the foundation that supports amazing sex and intimacy.

Consent

Clear expectations, open communication, and established boundaries all are important in a positive, sexual relationship. No one should feel pressured into having sex. It doesn’t matter if they’ve bought you cab fare, dinner, a purse, helped with your rent or tuition, if you’ve been together one day, one week, one month… you get the idea. YOU decide when to start a sexual relationship with someone and if you feel pressure or obligation or expectations to jump into bed with someone, head to the nearest exit instead.

And while we’re on the topic, have you ever started out saying yes and then at some point in the evening, changed your mind? Perfectly OK! You can stop at any time, and your partner must respect it. Drugs and alcohol can also impair your ability to think clearly, make decisions, and communicate your intentions. So, you can’t give the green light if you’re under the influence, and it goes without saying that if you pass out or fall asleep, you definitely are not able to give your consent.

Remember, it’s your body, your terms. No one else gets to influence or impact how you use it but you.

Communication

Open communication is key for everyone’s enjoyment. Be clear about what you like and don’t like. Here are a few great questions to ask your partner: “Is there anything you’d like me to do differently?” “Are you still ok with this?” “Does this feel good?” “Do you want to keep going?”  Own your desire and your sexual appetite. Don’t assume your partner should know what you like, or worse, are worried how they may react if you’re honest about what turns you on.

Safer Sex & Contraception

Adopt safe sex and contraception methods to protect yourself and partners from sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unwanted pregnancies. Lower your infection chances by avoiding high-risk behaviors. What activities will put you at risk? Unprotected intercourse, unprotected oral sex, multiple sex partners, and/or partners who are intravenous drug users. Some STIs can also be transmitted through non-sexual activity, like sharing needles or breastfeeding.  Almost half of all STIs happen to people under the age of 25. Some STIs do not manifest any symptoms immediately and can damage your health further and infect a partner without realizing it.

The bottom line is: don’t take chances with your health. Use protection, get tested regularly, and if you think you may have an infection, seek treatment immediately. Refrain from having sex while waiting for your appointment and inform your sexual partners.

Celebrate You

Above all else, be confident and comfortable with who you are. How you interact and connect with others, how you go through your day, and your ability to experience joy all comes down to one thing: having a healthy self-image. What goes through your mind when you see yourself in the mirror? A positive perception means that you’re not comparing yourself to some unattainable idea of perfection; it means accepting your body for what it is and celebrating your shape and size and how your body does what it does.

Pay attention to your inner dialogue, to all the things you say to yourself.  Negative thoughts can influence how we feel about our bodies and our sexuality. A positive attitude and positive thinking are incredibly powerful – avoid trying to be perfect, nobody is. You are enough.

Look after yourself, give yourself a treat occasionally,  and spend time doing something you love. Watch your favorite movie, or sing along to your favorite song, put on something you feel great in, call up someone you can share a laugh with.

Remember to value yourself and to celebrate yourself every chance you get.

Be positive! Be informed! Be You!
